# KIWI-the-kiwish-assistent

Kiwi is a assistent that includes a To-Do list, Link shortcuts, Meeting schedueler and a time clock. It's made with Javascript, HTML and CSS. It uses localStorage to store the data. If something doesn't work (but it should) try to refresh the browser, if it doesnt fix it please notify me on Discord. The code is very messy, read it at you'r own risk. I used this project for learning JvaScript. Thats my second project that uses Javascript, the first was a simple area and perimeter calculator, but this project uses way more JavaScript. I  always liked Python more than JS but after this project...I think I can say I like JS more.

## How to install or use it?
Go on https://daki-dm.github.io/ and try it out.

## Functions

### TO-DO LLIST
Just a simple To-Do list.

### LINK SHORTCUTS
You just put in the first form the link of the webside and in the second the title of the link. It will cereate a button and if you click on it it sends you on the webside link.

### MEETING MANAGER
You select the date and time and you see all your events.

### CLOCK
What can I say - a clock.

### NOTES
You just write in quick notes and they stay stored.

## Creator
I'm 13 years old and i like coding. I use Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS. And I'm not good with titles and desighning...
